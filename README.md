## Development Setup

This application uses Docker for local development. Please make sure to
[install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/mac/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

To set the application up, please copy the `.env-dist` file to one named `.env`
and then update the variables starting with `AWS_` with the appropriate.

Set the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` variable using the output of the following command:

```shell
python -c "from django.utils.crypto import get_random_string; print(get_random_string(50))"
```

To start the application, run:

```shell
make up
```

## Quick troubleshooting guide

#### Docker gives an error message similar to `ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?`

* Run the command as administrator/superuser (for testing purposes, that is).

* Make sure the user is in the `docker` group (use the `sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}` command to do this). This allows the user to use Docker without superuser privileges. Note that this does not take effect until the user logs out and logs in again.

#### Docker-Compose gives an error message similar to `ERROR: client and server don't have same version (client : 1.21, server: 1.18)`

Make sure to install the latest versions of both Docker and Docker-Compose. The current versions of these in the Debian repositories might not be mutually compatible.

#### Docker gives an error message similar to `Err http://security.debian.org jessie/updates InRelease`

* The installed Docker version is possibly too old. Make sure to use the latest available stable version.

* Ensure that the DNS configuration is sane: see if `docker-compose run web ping security.debian.org` can connect successfully.

#### Django gives an error message similar to `OperationalError: SOME_TABLE doesn't exist`

* The database likely isn't set up correctly.

* Run `make migrate` to update it.

#### Django gives some other form of `OperationalError`, and we don't really care about the data that's already in the database (e.g., while developing or testing)

* Database errors are usually caused by an improper database configuration. For development purposes, recreating the database will often solve the issue.

#### Django gives an error message similar to `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_frozen_credentials'`.

* The AWS credentials on the current machine are likely not correctly set.

* Set them in your **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES** (these environment variables are transferred to the docker container, from definitions in `.env`).

* See the [relevant section of the Boto3 docs](https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/configuration.html#environment-variables) for more details.

#### Django raises a 404 when trying to login

* Google Developer credentials are needed to get the Google authentication workflow running.

* Go to [console.developers.google.com](https://console.developers.google.com/), create a new project

* Click on "credentials" and create a new "OAuth client ID"

  * Application type: "Web application"

  * Name: ATMO (e.g. append "dev" or similar for local development)

  * Authorized redirect URIs:
    `<protocol>://<hostname>[:<port>]/accounts/google/login/callback/`
    (e.g.: `http://localhost:8000/accounts/google/login/callback/` for
    local development)

  * With the client ID and client secret run the following to add them to
    the django-allauth config system:

    ```shell
    docker-compose run web ./manage.py add_google_credentials --client-id=CLIENT_ID --client-secret=CLIENT_SECRET
    ```

## Python dependencies

Python dependencies are installed using pip during the Docker image build
process. As soon as you build the docker image using `make build` it'll
check if the `requirements.txt` file has changed and rebuilds the container
image if needed.

To add a new Python dependency please:

* Add it to the `requirements.txt` file, including a hash for pip's
  [hash checking mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#hash-checking-mode).

* Run `make build` on the host machine.

That will rebuild the images used by docker-compose.

## Front-end dependencies

The front-end dependencies are installed when building the Docker images
just like Python dependencies.

To add a new dependency to ATMO, please:

* Add it to the `packages.json` file

* Run `make build` on the host machine

* Extend the `NPM_FILE_PATTERNS` setting in the `settings.py`
  file with the files that are needed to be copied by Django's
  `collectstatic` management command.

That will rebuild the images used by docker-compose.

## Run the tests

There's a sample test in `tests/test_users.py` for your convenience,
that you can run using the following command on your computer:

    make test

This will spin up a Docker container to run the tests, so please set up
the development setup first.

## Heroku Setup

1. `heroku create`

1. Add Heroku Postgres and Redis hobby add-ons

1. Set the appropriate config variables, e.g.:

   ```shell
   heroku config:set DJANGO_DEBUG=False DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=<foobar>.herokuapp.com, DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=something_secret
   ```
   `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` gets populated by Heroku once you setup a database.

1. Run `heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-multi.git` since we're using multiple Heroku buildpacks (see `.buildpacks`)

1. Push branch to GitHub with `git push origin`

## NewRelic Monitoring

A newrelic.ini file is already included. To enable NewRelic monitoring
add two enviroment variables:

* `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`
* `NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE` to `/app/newrelic.ini`
* `NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT` to either `staging` or `production`
* `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`
* `NEW_RELIC_LOG` to `stdout`

See the [full list of environment variables](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#environment-variables) supported by Newrelic.
